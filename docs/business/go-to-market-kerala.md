# Go-to-Market Strategy -- Kerala

**LabCore LIMS** | Business Document | February 2025

---

## 1. Market Entry Strategy

LabCore launches in Kerala with a hyper-local, relationship-driven go-to-market approach. We are not running national ad campaigns or trying to acquire thousands of users. We are finding 10 small lab owners, solving their problems personally, and earning their trust enough that they recommend us to 10 more.

**Core philosophy**: In Kerala's close-knit medical community, trust spreads through personal networks. One happy lab owner in Thrissur will bring five more from the same district. Our GTM strategy is built on this network effect.

## 2. Target Geography

### 2.1 Phase 1 Launch Districts (Months 1--6)


| District  | Why                                                                               | Estimated Target Labs |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Ernakulam | Highest lab density in Kerala; Kochi metro area; mix of urban and semi-urban labs | 30--40                |
| Thrissur  | Strong medical community; cultural capital; many independent pathology labs       | 20--30                |
| Kozhikode | North Kerala hub; large number of small labs in city and surrounding towns        | 20--25                |


**Focus areas within districts**: Not Kochi city centre (chain-dominated), but towns like Aluva, Perumbavoor, Angamaly, Chalakudy, Irinjalakuda, Vadakara -- where small standalone labs are the norm.

### 2.2 Phase 2 Expansion (Months 6--12)


| District           | Estimated Target Labs |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Thiruvananthapuram | 25--30                |
| Malappuram         | 20--25                |
| Kannur             | 15--20                |
| Kottayam           | 10--15                |
| Kollam             | 10--15                |


### 2.3 Phase 3 Expansion (Year 2)

- Remaining Kerala districts (Palakkad, Alappuzha, Idukki, Wayanad, Kasaragod, Pathanamthitta)
- Tamil Nadu border areas (Coimbatore, Madurai -- Tamil language support added)
- Karnataka border areas (Mangalore, Mysore -- Kannada language support added)

## 3. Customer Acquisition Channels

### 3.1 Channel 1: Direct Lab Visits (Primary -- Months 1--3)

**What**: Visit small pathology labs in target towns, demonstrate LabCore on a laptop, and offer a free 30-day trial.

**How**:

1. Identify 50--100 small labs in Ernakulam/Thrissur/Kozhikode using Google Maps, JustDial, and local medical directories
2. Visit in person (no cold calls -- Kerala lab owners respond to face-to-face interaction)
3. Spend 15--20 minutes understanding their current workflow and pain points
4. Demo LabCore: register a patient, enter results, generate a report, send via WhatsApp -- all in 10 minutes
5. Offer free 30-day trial with their real data (migrate their test list and rate card during the visit)
6. Follow up weekly during the trial via WhatsApp

**Target**: Visit 10 labs/week. Convert 3--4 to paid within 45 days.

**Cost**: Travel and time only (no ad spend). Estimated INR 2,000--3,000/week for fuel and miscellaneous.

### 3.2 Channel 2: WhatsApp Community (Primary -- Ongoing)

**What**: Create a WhatsApp group for Kerala lab owners using LabCore. This becomes a peer support community, feature feedback channel, and organic referral engine.

**How**:

1. Seed the group with initial trial/paying customers
2. Post tips, feature announcements, and NABL preparation guides
3. Encourage members to share experiences and help each other
4. Lab owners in the group naturally recommend LabCore to peers outside the group

**Target**: 50 members by month 3, 150 by month 6.

**Why it works**: Kerala lab owners are active WhatsApp users. A community of peers sharing lab software experiences is genuinely useful and creates belonging. Competitors don't offer this.

### 3.3 Channel 3: Medical Association Partnerships (Secondary -- Months 3--6)

**What**: Partner with local branches of the Indian Medical Association (IMA Kerala), Kerala State Pathologists' Association, and district-level medical society groups.

**How**:

1. Approach IMA district branches in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kozhikode
2. Offer to present a session on "Digital Transformation for Small Labs" or "NABL Preparation Using Software" at their monthly meetings
3. Provide special pricing or extended trial for association members
4. Sponsor small lab-related events (CME programmes, quality workshops)

**Target**: Partnership with 3--5 local medical association chapters by month 6.

### 3.4 Channel 4: Medical Equipment Distributor Partnerships (Secondary -- Months 4--8)

**What**: Partner with local distributors who sell lab equipment (analysers, reagents, consumables) to small labs. When they sell a Mindray or Erba analyser, they recommend LabCore for LIMS.

**How**:

1. Identify 3--5 major lab equipment distributors in Kerala
2. Offer distributor commission (10--15% of first-year subscription) for each referred lab
3. Provide co-branded marketing materials
4. Bundle LabCore with analyser interfacing as a value-add

**Why it works**: Equipment distributors visit labs regularly and have trusted relationships. A recommendation from the person who sold the lab its analyser carries weight.

### 3.5 Channel 5: Online Presence (Supporting -- Ongoing)

**What**: Basic online presence for credibility and inbound leads. Not a major acquisition channel for Year 1.

**Components**:

- Simple landing page (labcore.in): product overview, pricing, trial signup, contact
- Google Business listing for local search visibility
- LinkedIn content: founder posts about building LabCore, Indian lab tech, NABL preparation tips
- YouTube: 3--5 short demo videos (Malayalam + English) showing key workflows
- SEO: Target keywords like "pathology lab software Kerala", "LIMS software India affordable", "lab report WhatsApp delivery"

**Budget**: INR 2,000--5,000/month for domain, hosting, and basic Google Ads (if needed).

## 5. Pricing as a Competitive Weapon

### 5.1 Positioning Statement

> "LabCore gives your lab professional reports, WhatsApp delivery, and NABL-ready audit trails -- for less than INR 500 a month. That's less than your lab's daily tea budget."

### 5.2 Pricing Conversation Script (Lab Visit)

When the lab owner asks "How much?":

1. "Our Starter plan is INR 499 per month. That includes everything you need: patient registration, billing, result entry, PDF reports, WhatsApp delivery, and audit trail."
2. "There's no setup fee, no onboarding charge. You try it free for 30 days."
3. "If you compare with CrelioHealth, their cheapest plan is INR 8,000 per month plus INR 10,000 for onboarding. We're 16 times cheaper and you get WhatsApp delivery included."
4. "At INR 499, it's less than what you spend on register books and printing paper every month."

### 5.3 ROI Story (For Hesitant Lab Owners)


| Without LabCore                               | With LabCore                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 3+ hours/day on manual reports                | 30 minutes/day -- auto-generated PDF reports     |
| Manual WhatsApp delivery (2 mins per patient) | One-click WhatsApp delivery                      |
| Patients wait 4--8 hours for reports          | Reports ready in 1--2 hours                      |
| Billing errors, lost payments                 | Accurate GST billing with payment tracking       |
| No NABL audit trail                           | Complete audit trail from day one                |
| **Result**: Lost patients to chain labs       | **Result**: Competitive service, patient loyalty |


"If LabCore saves your technician 2 hours per day, that's 60 hours per month. At INR 499/month, you're paying INR 8 per hour saved. Can you find a better investment?"

## 6. Retention and Expansion Strategy

### 6.1 Reducing Churn


| Risk Factor                         | Mitigation                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lab owner doesn't see value quickly | Onboarding ensures first report generated within 24 hours of trial start |
| Technical issues / bugs             | WhatsApp-based support with < 4-hour response time                       |
| Staff resistance to new software    | Simple UI; offer free 30-minute training video call for staff            |
| Competitor offers lower price       | Already the lowest; emphasise Malayalam, offline, WhatsApp features      |
| Lab closes / goes out of business   | Unavoidable; maintain < 5% monthly churn target                          |


### 6.2 Expansion Revenue


| Trigger                   | Upsell                                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab hires more staff      | Upgrade from Starter (2 users) to Growth (5 users) |
| Lab buys an analyser      | Sell analyser interfacing (Growth plan + setup)    |
| Lab opens second location | Upgrade to Pro (multi-branch)                      |
| Lab pursues NABL          | Growth or Pro plan for QC features                 |
| Lab wants patient portal  | Pro plan                                           |


Target: 15--20% of customers upgrade plans within 12 months.
